DETECTIVE: Hey, Alex. Thanks for coming in. I know this isn’t easy.
ALEX: Thanks for that detective. Yeah, it’s been a tough few days.
DETECTIVE: Just want to ask a few things. No pressure. You doing okay?
ALEX: I’ve been better. I mean... he was my dad. Whatever issues we had, this wasn’t supposed to happen. He was my hero.
DETECTIVE: Let’s talk about Saturday night. Where were you?
ALEX: At my apartment. Downtown. I stayed in. Didn’t really feel like going out.
DETECTIVE: Anyone with you?
ALEX: No. Just me. Watched some TV. Answered emails. That’s about it.
DETECTIVE: No visitors, no calls?
ALEX: Nope. Just a quiet night.
DETECTIVE: How was your relationship with your father lately?
ALEX: *sighs* Complicated. We didn’t agree on much. Especially when it came to the company.
DETECTIVE: You wanted change. He didn’t?
ALEX: Exactly. I had a modernization plan that could’ve saved us a fortune. He called it “reckless.” Said the old ways were better.
DETECTIVE: That frustrating?
ALEX: What do you think?
DETECTIVE: I want to ask you about a couple texts between you and Mary. March 10th, you said: “If only he’d just go away and let us run things.”
ALEX: *agitated* I was just venting. I didn’t mean anything by it. I was angry….. not dangerous.
DETECTIVE: Okay. And then on the 12th... the day your father was killed you said…. “Don’t worry. I’m working on something now that will help us get rid of our problem. This has to end.” What exactly were you working on Alex?
ALEX: That wasn’t about him. I was working on a presentation. Numbers. A pitch for the board to go around him, not… you know. That.
DETECTIVE: So you weren’t talking about your father when you said “our problem”
ALEX: …. I was. But not like that
DETECTIVE: Not like what?
ALEX: I wanted to present to the board without him. Cut him out of the vote. Not cut him out of…. existence.
DETECTIVE: So why not just say that on the text? Why make it so….. secretive?
ALEX: *quietly* Because I was afraid Mary would say it was weak. Or not enough. And... I needed her to believe in it.
DETECTIVE: Okay. Moving on…… So what time did you get to the crime scene?
ALEX: *distracted* I was already here.
DETECTIVE: ...........Sorry?
ALEX: I mean….. I meant I got here after I heard... about it. I misspoke.
DETECTIVE: You said you were at your apartment. Downtown. So how could you have already been here?
ALEX: *stammering* I…….. it was just a figure of speech. I meant once I heard, I rushed over. I must’ve been nervous. That’s all.
DETECTIVE: That’s not something you say by accident.
ALEX: *panicked* I don’t know! I misspoke, okay? What are you trying to say? That I killed my dad?
DETECTIVE: It’s just an odd thing to “accidentally” say.
ALEX: *clenched jaw* This is ridiculous.
DETECTIVE: Listen, I get it….. nerves can twist things. It’s been a hell of a few days for you and your family. I’m just trying to understand.
ALEX: *tears start streaming* I would NEVER kill my father. He was an amazing dad. He was my hero.
DETECTIVE: Okay. Well I see you’re upset. So we’ll call it a day, okay? Thanks for coming in Alex. I’m truly sorry for everything you’re going through.
ALEX: Thanks. 
DETECTIVE: *thinking to himself* It seems like he’s hiding something. I just don’t know what.
