DETECTIVE: Thanks for coming in, Mary.
MARY: Let’s make this clear…. I’m only here voluntarily. If this turns accusatory, I’ll be calling my attorney.
DETECTIVE: Wow. Pretty defensive….. I’m just trying to get a sense of the night. You were close to John, right? Longtime colleagues and all.
MARY: ……. obviously
DETECTIVE: Then maybe you can help me fill in some blanks. Where were you Saturday night?
MARY: At home. Alone. Working. That’s all I’m saying without legal counsel present.
DETECTIVE: Late night work, huh?
MARY: Yes. Some of us don’t sleep easy when our company’s collapsing.
DETECTIVE: So you knew the numbers weren’t adding up. Did John ever talk to you about that?
MARY: Of course. It’s something we talked about a lot near the end.
DETECTIVE: I see. So did you see him at all that evening?
MARY: I already told you. No.
DETECTIVE: Anyone who can confirm you were home?
MARY: No. And unless you're accusing me of something, that's all you get.
DETECTIVE: *Opens folder* I see you and Alex messaged a lot that weekend. Let’s talk about this one from March 11th where Alex said “Don’t worry… I’m working on something that’ll help us get rid of our problem. This has to end.” 
DETECTIVE: He just told me that was about a work presentation. That’s a strong way to describe a “presentation,” don’t you think?
MARY: *slightly snaps* That message doesn’t mean what you think it does.
DETECTIVE: Okay, then why don’t you help me understand what that message does mean.
MARY: We were talking about the company. About how John wasn’t moving with the times. Alex was trying to fix it. He was under incredible pressure.
DETECTIVE: So then you and Alex are pretty close, huh?
MARY: *defensive* Yes. I know him. I also know he didn’t do this.
DETECTIVE: Well how are you so sure? I mean, you left and went home, didn’t you?
MARY: Yes…..
DETECTIVE: You sure?
MARY: What are you even getting at?
DETECTIVE: I don’t know, call it a hunch…. I mean, he was fuzzy on his alibi. Said he was at his apartment, but then said he might have been at the estate. Something just didn’t add up.
MARY: He’s not a liar.
DETECTIVE: Seems like he could have been. So how do you know so confidently he didn’t do this? 
MARY: I just know…….
DETECTIVE: Well were you with him?
MARY: *frustrated* I already told you…. NO!
DETECTIVE: Okay, okay….. So moving on….. where were you when you got the call?
MARY: *annoyed* Well, when we heard the……...I mean, when I got the call.
DETECTIVE: *interrupts* Woah, hold on….. You said we.
MARY: *silence*
DETECTIVE: Who’s “we” Mary?
MARY: *silence*
DETECTIVE: You were with him, weren’t you?
MARY: I’m not discussing my private life without legal counsel. But you’ve got the wrong Wallace.
DETECTIVE: *leans in* What’s that supposed to mean?
MARY: You're chasing Alex like a dog on a bone. But Emily? She’s the one you should be looking at.
DETECTIVE: Emily Wallace?
MARY: Obviously….. She’s crazy. She confronted me a week before the murder. Accused me of knowing about John and Lisa having an affair, which wasn’t happening by the way…. John would NEVER do that to her. But she thought I knew about it and was helping John hide it. Said she’d “kill him” if the affair was real.
DETECTIVE: So you're saying she had motive?
MARY: Motive? I once saw her charge at him. Screaming. Absolutely unhinged. She was drunk and naked and waving one of his old trophies around like a weapon.
DETECTIVE: Do you think she might have been stealing from him too?
MARY: No. Lisa was the thief. She had access, she moved the money, and she always had a convenient excuse.
DETECTIVE: But you just said Emily might’ve..
MARY: *interrupts* I'm saying if you want to talk about rage and passion, you look at Emily. If you want to talk about fraud and opportunity, you look at Lisa.
MARY: And since we’re laying it all out now… You might want to talk to that creepy neighbor.
DETECTIVE: Tom Wilson?
MARY: Yeah. He’s been hanging around the guest house. Poking around. I’ve caught him staring through the windows at least twice.
DETECTIVE: Interesting…… How many times have you stayed in their guest house?
MARY: *silence*
DETECTIVE: *starts pacing* Okay…… so let me get this straight...Alex is innocent. Emily’s unhinged. Lisa’s a thief. And the neighbor’s a peeping Tom? 
DETECTIVE: Funny how everyone else seems guilty……. Except you.
MARY’S ATTORNEY: *walks in aggressively* That’s all you’ll be getting from my client today. This interrogation is over.
DETECTIVE: *thinking to himself* She’s definitely hiding something. I know it….. But what could it be and what else is she lying about?
