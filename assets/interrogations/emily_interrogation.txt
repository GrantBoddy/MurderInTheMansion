DETECTIVE: Mrs. Wallace, thank you for coming in.
EMILY: *hoarse* It’s strange hearing my name like that… without John. *small pause*
EMILY: I still sign his last name, like he’s still here.
DETECTIVE: *gently* I’m so sorry. I can’t imagine what you’re going through and how you’re feeling.
EMILY: Have you ever lost someone and still smell them on the pillow the next morning?
DETECTIVE: No, I haven’t. But if I had, I would definitely want to figure out what happened to them. Let’s talk through Saturday night. Just walk me through it.
EMILY: *exhales shakily* Sure.
DETECTIVE: So you were at a charity event that night, right?
EMILY: Yes. The 23-Hour Ball. Cute, right? Some joke about Daylight Saving Time — about losing time but gaining hope or something. They had a slideshow, big donor push, champagne tower.
EMILY: Unfortunately though, I didn’t make it to the end of the event.
DETECTIVE: Why not?
EMILY: It’s so embarrassing but because I drank too much and said too much. I made a scene. Made a fool of myself. So I was asked to leave but I was way too drunk to drive. So I got a hotel room, and passed out.
DETECTIVE: You were alone in the hotel?
EMILY: Yes.
DETECTIVE: Anyone see you?
EMILY: The night manager at the hotel, I guess. But I wasn’t… I didn’t want to be seen. I just wanted to disappear.
DETECTIVE: *slides file over to Emily* These are your messages to your friend Sarah. From March 10th. You said “If I find proof he’s cheating with her, I swear I’ll kill him.”
EMILY: *visibly shaken* I didn’t mean it like that.
DETECTIVE: How did you mean it?
EMILY: Like… I’d yell. Or leave him. Or throw his expensive art down the stairs. Not… that.
DETECTIVE: So you really believed he was cheating?
EMILY: *nods slowly* Yeah. With Lisa. She was always there. Always too close. Too comfortable.
EMILY:Touching his arm. Laughing at everything. It looked obvious.
DETECTIVE: Do you think Lisa could’ve hurt him?
EMILY: Maybe. She’s the kind of woman who adapts. If it came down to self-preservation… maybe. But I also don’t know what to believe anymore.
DETECTIVE: Well do you still think she was with him?
EMILY: I don’t know. Everything’s different now. I’m not mad at him anymore. I just… I just wish he’d come back.
DETECTIVE: I hear you, for what it’s worth….. Mary said that they weren’t. She said that John would NEVER do that to you.
EMILY: *starts tearing up*
DETECTIVE: She also said something else that was pretty interesting though. 
EMILY: What was that?
DETECTIVE: Well she actually thinks that you might have killed John………
EMILY: Me? That I killed John???? How could she…… I don’t…… I don’t get how she could think that. Do you believe her?
DETECTIVE: I don’t believe anything yet. I’m just telling you what she said.
EMILY: I can’t believe she said that….. Don’t believe everything she says though. She’s not a saint. She’s been circling Alex like a vulture for months. She’s twice his age and half as subtle. Has been lying to our faces the whole time.
DETECTIVE: Well she said you were drunk. Angry. That you lunged at John once.
EMILY: And? I never said I was perfect. But saying I killed him? That’s desperate.
DETECTIVE: So then she’s mistaken? But do you think she’s just honestly confused, or do you think she’s knowingly lying and trying to push us in your direction?
EMILY: It wouldn’t be the first time she’s lied. 
DETECTIVE: Yeah, you’ve mentioned that. What else has she lied about?
EMILY: I haven’t seen it with my own two eyes yet, but I’m 95% sure she’s been having a romantic relationship with my son.
DETECTIVE: Huh….. Interesting. So then do you think she might have done it?
DETECTIVE: OR.......*small pause*
DETECTIVE: Or do you think she’s covering for someone else…….
EMILY: Like who?
DETECTIVE: *carefully* Emily… I have to ask. We’ve received information that suggests Alex might’ve been involved. Do you think your son could have killed his father?
EMILY: *sharply* What? How…… How could you even ask such a thing?!?
DETECTIVE: We have to follow every lead……
EMILY: *interrupts* Every lead?!? He’s my baby boy. Sure, they argued, who doesn’t? And yeah, sometimes they butted heads about the company….. But kill his father? No. No, never. Alex WORSHIPPED and LOVED his father.
DETECTIVE: *softer* We just have to follow where the evidence leads.
EMILY: *tearing up* Then you’re being led in the wrong direction.
DETECTIVE: Emily…. We received a letter. Anonymous. It pointed directly to Alex. Gave us the location of what might be the murder weapon.
EMILY: *voice breaks* No………
DETECTIVE: I’m sorry, but….
EMILY: *tears falling* He just lost his father. And now you want to make him a suspect?
DETECTIVE: *quietly* Emily…..
EMILY: *breaking down* He's already drowning, and you're handing him weights.
DETECTIVE: Okay, let’s stop for now. Emily, I’m sorry. This is the worst part of my job.
EMILY: *wiping her face* This was NOT Alex. This was NOT my baby. You HAVE to trust me.
DETECTIVE: Well, I hope you’re right. And I’m sorry again for all of this. I truly am.
EMILY: Look, I don’t know who did it. I just know I wake up every morning and forget for two seconds that he’s gone. Then I remember. And it’s like dying again.
DETECTIVE: I’m sorry Emily. We’re going to figure this out. Thank you for your time.
EMILY: *slowly stands* I loved him, you know. Even when I hated him.
DETECTIVE: I know. And from what I’ve gathered it sounds like John really loved you too.
EMILY: *walks out as she starts crying again*
DETECTIVE: *thinking to himself* Ugh. That was rough. I feel so sad for her. But I have to keep in mind that her alibi isn’t that strong.
