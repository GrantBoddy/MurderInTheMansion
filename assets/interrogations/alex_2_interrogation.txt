DETECTIVE: Hello Alex.
ALEX: Detective….. Back so soon?
DETECTIVE: *slaps folder on table*  This isn’t a check-in. We need to talk.
ALEX: Okay? Let me guess….. You think you found something.
DETECTIVE: We did find something, and we need answers.
DETECTIVE: Your Glock 19. Serial number GLK123456. We recovered it from under your mattress. Ballistics report came back this morning.
ALEX: Okay..... and?
DETECTIVE: Well, it’s the gun that killed your father. Exact match. Bullet striations. Tool marks. Ninety-nine percent certainty.
ALEX: *quietly* No... That’s not possible.
DETECTIVE: It was cleaned. Wiped down. No prints. But it’s yours. And it fired the shot.
ALEX: ….. I don’t understand…… My gun is the murder weapon?
DETECTIVE: Yes, care to explain? Maybe with how it ended up back under your bed?
ALEX: No. I don’t know. I haven’t touched that gun in weeks. Whoever did this…… they must have planted it there.
DETECTIVE: That’s convenient.
ALEX: Are you serious? You think I shot my own father and put the weapon back in my room?
DETECTIVE: Maybe…..
ALEX: *silence*
DETECTIVE: *opens notes* Let’s go back. First interview. You said you were at your apartment.
ALEX: Yeah…..?
DETECTIVE: But you slipped. Said “I was already here.”
ALEX: Yeah……?
DETECTIVE: *stares intensely deep into Alex’s eyes*
ALEX: *pauses, then exhales hard* Ughhhh….. Alright. You’re right. I was at the estate.
DETECTIVE: Now we’re getting somewhere…. Why did you lie?
ALEX: Because……. It was supposed to be a secret.
DETECTIVE: ….. go on……
ALEX: *sighs* Okay, okay….. I was in the guest house. With Mary.
DETECTIVE: Mary Johnson?
ALEX: *nods* Yeah. We’ve been seeing each other for months. We didn’t want anyone to know. ESPECIALLY him.
DETECTIVE: So Mary’s your alibi now?
ALEX: Well yeah, I mean it’s the truth…….
DETECTIVE: *pauses* Alex, how do you expect me to believe you? You’ve already lied to me…….
ALEX: No, I’m telling the truth now. I promise.
DETECTIVE: And why should I believe that?
ALEX: Because, like I said, it’s the truth……
DETECTIVE: Alex, I’m going to need something to believe you.
ALEX: *pauses to think* OH! Wait! We have selfies from that night…. In bed together in the guesthouse.
DETECTIVE: Okay. But those pictures could be from any other time you guys were sneaking around in there.
ALEX: No! Pictures contain metadata these days. Shows the time and location. Oh yeah! Plus, we both wear our Apple Watches to bed to track our sleep. They will show we never left the guest house!
DETECTIVE: Hmmmm……. Sounds airtight. 
ALEX: See, I told you!
DETECTIVE: Unless……
ALEX: …… unless what?
DETECTIVE: Unless the two of you were working together. I mean, you could have taken your watches off. Go get rid of John. Take over the company. Alex Wallace and his girlfriend, side by side at the top.
ALEX: *slams fist on the table* Don’t say that! I didn’t kill him.
DETECTIVE: *silent*
ALEX: *voice cracking* Yeah, I wanted more power. More responsibility. More respect. But that’s because I wanted to make my dad proud of me. I wanted to prove I was worth something to him.
And I wanted to earn it. I spent my whole life trying to get that man to see me. To think I wasn’t just some screw-up with a flashy PowerPoint.
DETECTIVE: Well that’s not what the letter says.
ALEX: *glaring* Letter? What letter?
DETECTIVE: An anonymous tip we received. Said you’ve been planning this for months. Said you bragged about your Glock. Called it your “insurance policy.” Also said you have a history of violence. 
ALEX: *shaking head slowly* I’m being set up…. Someone wanted you looking at me…. not them.
DETECTIVE: Like who?
ALEX: *quietly* I don’t know. But I didn’t kill my father.
DETECTIVE: I don’t know Alex….. A lot of things are pointing us in your direction.
ALEX: *leans back, voice hollow* I just wanted him to be proud of me……
ALEX: *lowers his head* And now I don’t know if he ever was.
DETECTIVE: ………
DETECTIVE: Alex, he was proud of you. I’ve been reading all of his texts, emails, and notes. He tested you because he knew how smart and how strong you are. He wanted to push you to become greater. Greater than him even…..
ALEX: *starts crying*
DETECTIVE: I mean, he left Wallace Enterprises to you, right? You’re in control. It’s yours. Do you think he would have left the business he started and built for decades to just anyone? No. He wouldn’t. 
ALEX: *wiping tears*
DETECTIVE: I just really hope he didn’t make a mistake in doing that.
ALEX: You know……. I’ve waited for this moment for years. I just didn’t expect it to be like….. this. 
DETECTIVE: I’m sure…… Well get me those pictures. We’ll work on pulling the GPS data from your Apple Watches. I really hope you’re telling the truth. 
ALEX: *composes himself and walks out*
DETECTIVE: *thinking to himself* This case is tricky. I just don’t know who to believe anymore…..
