   - Phone shows call at 3:30 AM

3. Computer Log vs. Manual Security Log:

   - Manual log shows exit at 4:00 AM
   - One hour difference due to DST

This evidence shows how Lisa used the DST change to create a false alibi. The key is comparing auto-adjusted systems (security, phone, computer) with non-adjusted systems (receipts, manual logs) to spot the time discrepancies.
