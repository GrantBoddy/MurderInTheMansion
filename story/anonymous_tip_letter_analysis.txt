Atlanta Police Department - Homicide Division

I'm writing to you anonymously because I fear for my safety. I have information about John Wallace's murder 
that you need to know. You need to look into Alex Wallace. He's been waiting for this moment for years. 
His father was blocking his modernization plans for the company, and Alex was getting desperate. 
He's been telling people for months that he wished his father would "just disappear" so he could take over 
and get his inheritance.
I know Alex has a violent past. There were at least three incidents where he assaulted people, but his father 
always paid off the victims to keep it quiet. One time, he nearly killed a guy in a bar fight, but John paid 
the guy $50,000 to drop the charges. Another time, he attacked a business rival who was criticizing his 
modernization plans. That one cost John $75,000 to make go away.
Alex is obsessed with guns. He has several firearms, but there's one you need to find - a Glock 19 that he keeps 
under his mattress. He brags about it to his friends, saying it's his "insurance policy" against anyone who gets 
in his way. I think you'll find that gun matches the bullet that killed his father. Check his financial records too. 
He's been making large withdrawals recently, probably to pay someone off. And look at his phone records from the 
night of the murder. He was at the office much later than he claims.
I can't reveal who I am, but I worked closely with the Wallace family for years. I've seen the real Alex, and trust 
me, he's capable of this.

Sincerely,
A Concerned Citizen

EVIDENCE IMPLICATIONS
--------------------
1. Initial Investigation:
   - Letter leads police to search Alex's room
   - They find the Glock 19 under his mattress
   - Ballistics match confirms it's the murder weapon
   - This creates strong evidence against Alex

2. The Truth:
   - Lisa knew about Alex's gun collection
   - She used his Glock 19 to commit the murder
   - She returned the gun to his room to frame him
   - The anonymous letter was part of her framing attempt

3. Key to Solving:
   - Alex's alibi checks out (he was with Mary)
   - The timing doesn't match (Alex was seen leaving earlier)
   - The letter's details about Alex's past are too specific
   - Only someone with inside knowledge could write this
   - The letter was printed, not handwritten, suggesting premeditation

FORENSIC ANALYSIS
----------------
1. Paper Analysis:
   - Common printer paper, available anywhere
   - No unique watermarks or identifying marks
   - Printer type: Common office laser printer

2. Envelope Analysis:
   - Standard #10 business envelope
   - Postmarked from Atlanta
   - No DNA or fingerprints
   - Stamp purchased with cash

3. Content Analysis:
   - Written by someone with intimate knowledge of the family
   - Details about past incidents are accurate
   - Focus on Alex's gun collection is suspiciously specific
   - Timing of the letter (sent day after murder) suggests premeditation

CONCLUSION
----------
The anonymous tip letter appears to be a crucial piece of evidence pointing to Alex's guilt, but it's actually 
part of Lisa's elaborate framing attempt. By using Alex's own gun and planting the anonymous tip, she created a 
perfect setup that would take time to unravel. The letter's specific details about Alex's past and his gun 
collection were designed to make the police focus on him while she established her alibi using the DST time 
discrepancy.
