Address: 1122 Park Avenue, Atlanta, GA
Relationship to Victim: Next-door neighbor

OFFICER'S NOTE: Statement given at scene, witness appears shaken but coherent. No signs of intoxication or 
impairment.

My name is Tom Wilson. I live right next door to John Wallace at 1122 Park Avenue. I've been his neighbor for 
about 15 years now. I'm retired, used to work in construction, so I'm usually up early and in bed by 9 PM. But 
last night... last night was different.

Earlier in the day, around 6 PM, I was out in my garden when I heard John and Alex going at it. I mean really 
yelling. I couldn't make out all the words, but I heard Alex shouting something about "modernization" and 
"ruining the company." John was trying to calm him down, but Alex just kept getting louder. At one point, I 
heard something crash - sounded like glass breaking. Then Alex stormed out, got in his car, and peeled out of 
there. I've never seen him that angry before.

I went to bed around 9 PM like usual, but I couldn't sleep. Kept thinking about that fight. Then, at exactly 
3:30 AM, I heard it - a gunshot. Clear as day. Came from John's house. I know what a gunshot sounds like - I 
used to hunt with my dad when I was younger. This was definitely a gunshot, no doubt about it.

I got up and looked out my bedroom window. That's when I saw Alex's bedroom light was on. I thought that was 
strange because I know Alex has his own place downtown. Why would he be in his old bedroom at 3:30 in the morning? 
I watched for a few minutes, and I swear I saw someone moving around in there. The light stayed on for about 5 
minutes, then went off.

I called 911 right away. I didn't want to go over there myself - not after hearing that gunshot and seeing Alex's
light on. I mean, after that fight earlier... it just seemed too coincidental, you know?

I've known Alex since he was a kid. He's always had a temper, but lately... it's been different. More intense. And 
that fight earlier... I've never heard him talk to his father like that before. I hate to say it, but I think Alex 
did this. I really do.

I'm willing to testify to all of this in court if needed. I just... I can't believe this happened. John was a good 
man. A good neighbor. This is just... it's just terrible.
