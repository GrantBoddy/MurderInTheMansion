- 10:45 PM: John calls Lisa to arrange meeting
- 11:00 PM: Lisa arrives at office

Sunday, March 13, 2023:
- 2:59 AM: Murder occurs (just before DST change)
- 3:00 AM: DST begins (Spring Forward)
- 3:15 AM: Lisa seen at gas station
- 3:30 AM: Neighbor hears gunshot
- 4:00 AM: Lisa leaves building (appears as 3:00 AM)
- 4:30 AM: Lisa makes alibi call (appears as 3:30 AM)

MOTIVE
------
Lisa's Motives:
1. Financial: John discovered her embezzlement
2. Professional: Her career was at risk
3. Criminal: Was going to be arrested and charged

EVIDENCE
--------
1. Time-Based Evidence:
   - Security system timestamps (auto-adjusted)
   - Phone records (auto-adjusted)
   - Gas station receipt (auto adjusted)
   - Crime scene photo with clock (not adjusted)
   - Neighbor's statement (correct time)

2. Financial Evidence:
   - Embezzlement records
   - Bank statements
   - Transfer documentation
   - John's investigation notes

3. Personal Evidence:
   - Text messages
   - Phone calls
   - Witness statements
   - Physical evidence (lipstick, etc.)

SOLUTION
--------
Key to solving the case:
1. Compare auto-adjusted vs. non-adjusted timestamps
2. Notice the DST change at 3:00 AM
3. Realize Lisa's alibi times don't match
4. Connect financial motive to opportunity
5. Prove she was present at time of murder

The critical realization is that:
- Murder happened at 2:59 AM
- DST changed at 3:00 AM
- Lisa's exit at 4:00 AM appears as 3:00 AM
- Her alibi call at 4:30 AM appears as 3:30 AM

- These times can't all be true
