EVIDENCE TIMESTAMPS AS THEY APPEAR:
---------------------------------
1. Non-Adjusting Systems (Show Actual Time):
   - Crime Scene Photo: 2:59 AM (wall clock)
   - Gas Station Receipt: 3:15 AM
   - Building Security Log (manual): 4:00 AM exit

2. Auto-Adjusting Systems (Show Adjusted Time):
   - Digital Security System: Shows exit at 3:00 AM
   - Phone Records: Shows call at 3:30 AM
   - Computer Activity Logs: Show activity until 3:00 AM

KEY POINTS:
----------
1. The murder occurred at 2:59 AM, just before DST change
2. Lisa stayed to clean up evidence until 4:00 AM
3. When DST occurred at 3:00 AM:
   - Her 4:00 AM exit appears as 3:00 AM
   - Her 4:30 AM call appears as 3:30 AM
4. The neighbor's call at 3:30 AM is the correct new time
5. The gas station receipt at 3:15 AM is the actual time
6. The security footage showing 3:00 AM exit is actually 4:00 AM

This timeline shows how Lisa used the DST change to create a false alibi. The key contradiction is that she claims to have left at 3:00 AM and been home at 3:30 AM, but the gas station receipt shows her out at 3:15 AM, and the murder occurred at 2:59 AM.

CHARACTER ALIBIS
---------------
1. Emily Wallace:
   - Charity gala from 8:00 PM to 11:30 PM
   - Multiple witnesses confirm attendance
   - Receipt and ticket stub evidence

2. Alex Wallace:
   - Restaurant meeting from 9:00 PM to 11:15 PM
   - Mary Johnson confirms alibi
   - Restaurant receipt evidence

3. Mary Johnson:
   - Restaurant meeting with Alex
   - Security footage at restaurant
   - Credit card transaction evidence

4. Lisa Carter:
   - Claims to have left office at 3:00 AM
   - Claims to have been home at 3:30 AM
   - Claims to have never been there at time of murder (2:59 AM)

This creates the perfect confusion:
- Her alibi looks solid in digital records
- But physical evidence (gas station receipt, crime scene) shows true timeline
- The contradiction between adjusted and non-adjusted times reveals her guilt
